THE PROBLEM RIA PLATFORMS FACE
Your advisors need AI tools. But most AI in wealth management creates more risk than it solves:

Black-box calculations you can't explain when FINRA asks questions
Silent errors that go undetected until client harm occurs
Unpredictable outputs that change with identical inputs
Generic risk questionnaires that don't satisfy 2111 suitability requirements
Audit failures because you can't show your methodology

The stakes: Average FINRA violation costs $150K. Most platforms face 15+ violations annually. That's $2.25M in fines—plus the recruiting damage when word spreads that your compliance is shaky.

HOW VELOCITYIQ SOLVES THIS
Catch Every Error Before Recommendations Go Out
101 automated validation rules check data completeness, calculation integrity, and logical consistency before any analysis reaches an advisor. Nothing fails silently. Ever. When you see "FinCEN Residual Risk: 2.8/10," you know the analysis passed 101 quality checks.

Document FINRA 2111 Compliance Systematically
Stop relying on generic questionnaires. VelocityIQ generates complete FINRA Rule 2111 documentation for every strategy: reasonable-basis suitability, customer-specific scoring (quantified 0-100 across four factors), and quantitative suitability assessment. When FINRA asks how you assessed suitability, you hand them systematic documentation.

Show Regulators Every Formula and Assumption
200+ deterministic formulas per assessment. Every calculation traceable to source. Complete methodology documentation. Audits become box-ticking exercises because you can show exactly how every decision was made—no black-box explanations, no AI hand-waving.

WHO THIS IS FOR
Built for RIA platforms (200-2,000 advisors) whose advisors serve:

Technology executives navigating equity compensation complexity
Business owners planning exits, succession, or QSBS strategies
High-net-worth individuals requiring sophisticated tax optimization
Medical, legal, and dental practice owners needing niche expertise
Real estate investors managing 1031 exchanges and depreciation

If your platform needs systematic risk assessment and compliance documentation that regulators actually accept—and a recruiting edge over platforms still using generic tools—VelocityIQ is built for you.

WHY THIS WORKS: BANKING-GRADE FOUNDATIONS
VelocityIQ wasn't built by developers learning compliance from consultants. It was built by someone who spent years building compliance systems at NatWest and understands what regulators actually require.
Terry [Last Name], Founder & Chief Architect

3 years at NatWest building banking compliance systems
11 years software development experience
Banking-grade validation methodology expertise
Microsoft AI certifications (AZ-900, AI-102)

This background shows in the architecture:

Multiple verification touchpoints—automated validation, advisor review, client acknowledgment, compliance oversight
Deterministic execution—same inputs always produce same outputs, fully reproducible for audits
Zero silent errors by design—validation before calculation, consistency checking during processing, result verification after computation
Regulatory framework integration—FINRA Rule 2111 and FinCEN methodology embedded in core architecture

You're not buying experimental AI from a tech startup. You're buying compliance-first architecture from someone who brings banking compliance systems experience and 11+ years of software development rigor.

SEE IT IN ACTION
Schedule a 15-minute demonstration to see how VelocityIQ's compliance-first architecture provides systematic risk assessment and FINRA Rule 2111 documentation your platform can defend.

IMAGE GUAIDANCE

For fintech and B2B SaaS, the consistent guidance is that images are not decoration; they must clarify the product, signal trust, and support conversion.
​

Hero image principles
Use product-context visuals (e.g., your interface, an annotated dashboard, or a simple architecture diagram) rather than generic stock finance imagery. This helps buyers picture using the tool and builds trust.
​

Ensure the hero image directly reinforces the headline (e.g., show validation rules firing, an audit trail, or a FINRA report when you talk about compliance-first AI).
​

Keep the hero visually clean: avoid extra popups, busy backgrounds, or multiple competing elements that distract from the headline and primary CTA.
​

Imagery style and content
Prefer real UI + light, custom illustration over abstract flat illustrations alone; showing the actual product in context earns more trust in fintech.
​

Use visuals to simplify complex concepts: diagrams of your dual-layer risk engine, simple flows (Input → Validate → Assess → Document), and callouts on key screens.
​

Maintain a consistent visual language (icon set, illustration style, color system) across homepage sections to reinforce brand identity and reduce cognitive load.
​

Trust and human elements
Visuals should signal security and professionalism: restrained color palette, clear typography, and minimal gimmicky effects, which research highlights as important in fintech trust-building.
​

Add human/contextual imagery sparingly (e.g., a small founder photo or a team shot) to humanize the brand without distracting from the product story.
​

Performance and UX
Optimize all images so the homepage stays fast; slow-loading fintech sites erode trust and hurt conversions.
​

Ensure strong contrast between imagery, text, and CTAs so the copy remains readable over or alongside visuals.
​
